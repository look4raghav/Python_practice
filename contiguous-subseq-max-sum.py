"""
A contiguous subsequence of a list S is a subsequence made up of consecutive elements of S. For
instance, if S is:
    5. 15, -30, 10, -5, 40, 10
then 15, -30, 10 is a contiguous subsequence but 5, 15, 40 is not. Give a linear time algorithm for
the following task:
    Input: A list of numbers, a1, a2, ..., an
    Output: The contiguous subsequence of maximum sum (a subsequence of length zero has sum zero)
For the preceeding example, the answer would be 10, -5, 40, 10, with a sum of 55.
(Hint: For each j E{1, 2, ..., n}, consider contiguous subsequences ending exactly at position j.)
